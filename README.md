## üß∞ Steps to Install and Use

1. **Extract the Archive**
   - Use an archive tool (e.g., WinRAR, 7-Zip) to extract the contents of the `.zip` or `.7z` file to any folder of your choice.

2. **Disconnect from the Internet**
   - Before proceeding, it is **recommended to temporarily disconnect your internet connection** to prevent any automatic updates or network-based blocks during installation.

3. **Run the Installer (if available)**
   - If the extracted folder contains an installer (e.g., `SETUP.exe`, `INSTALL.exe`, or a custom installer):
     - Double-click to run the installer.
     - When prompted for a password, enter:
       ```
