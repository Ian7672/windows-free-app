# Windows App Installation Guide

This guide provides clear instructions to install and run **free Windows applications**, typically distributed in compressed formats (e.g., `.zip`, `.7z`). These apps may include an installer or can be launched directly via an executable file.

## ðŸ§° How to Install and Use

1. **Extract the Archive**
   - Use an archive utility such as WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the contents of the `.zip` or `.7z` file to any folder you prefer.

2. **Disconnect from the Internet (Mandatory)**
   - You **must temporarily disconnect your internet connection** before proceeding with the installation.
   - This is required to avoid automatic updates, telemetry, or network-based restrictions that might interfere with the setup process.

3. **Run the Installer (if included)**
   - If the extracted folder contains an installer (e.g., `SETUP.exe`, `INSTALL.exe`, or a custom installation file):
     - Double-click the installer to begin.
     - If prompted for a password, enter:
       ```

     - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4. **If No Installer Is Included**
   - Simply run the main application executable (e.g., `AppName.exe`) directly from the extracted folder.
